# SNUFA 2021

Like last year this online workshop brings together researchers in the field to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

This year's executive committee comprises [Chiara Bartolozzi](https://www.iit.it/people/chiara-bartolozzi), [Sander Boht√©](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~sbohte/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://fzenke.net/).


## Key dates

The workshop will take place **8-9 November, 2021**.

Abstract submission will close **1 October, 2021**.
