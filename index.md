The annual SNUFA online workshop brings together researchers in spiking neural networks to present their work and discuss translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits and novel brain-inspired computing approaches. Topics of interest include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing.

The workshops are organised by [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org/) and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org).
