# SNUFA 2021

The last years have seen many exciting new developments to train spiking neural networks to perform complex information processing. This online workshop brings together researchers in the field to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

The workshop is being organised by [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), [Friedemann Zenke](https://fzenke.net/), [Chiara Bartolozzi](https://www.iit.it/people/chiara-bartolozzi) and [Sander Boht√©](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~sbohte/).
