# SNUFA 2025

<img align="right" width="499" style="max-width: 40%" src="/images/snufa_hog.gif">

**Brief summary.** This online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

**Program committee.** [David Kappel](https://www.ini.rub.de/the_institute/people/david-kappel/), [Julijana Gjorgjieva](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/compneuro/home/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org/).

Attendance is free, but registration is required (to receive the streaming links).


## Abstract submission

**Deadline:** Sept 26, 2025 (anywhere on earth)

<span style="background: lightgreen; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; margin: 1px;"><a href="https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/XkZLavhaJe">Submit abstract</a></span>

Abstracts will be made publicly available at the end of the abstract submissions deadline for blinded public comments and ratings. We will select the most highly rated abstracts for contributed talks and flash talks, subject to maintaining a balance between the different fields of, broadly speaking, neuroscience, computer science and neuromorphic engineering. Abstracts not selected for a talk, and abstracts selected for a flash talk, will be presented as posters.
