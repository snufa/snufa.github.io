# Plasticity, activity, and computation in neuronal networks

**Authors:** Gabriel Ocker

**Presentation type:** Invited talk at [SNUFA 2023 online workshop (7-8 Nov 2023)](https://snufa.net/2023)

## Abstract

Slow spike timing-dependent plasticity exposes dynamical equations for network structure, driven by spike train correlations. I will review these dynamics and discuss frameworks for closing the loop between spike train statistics and synaptic plasticity in integrate-and-fire networks. Finally, I will discuss how nonlinearities in the plasticity rule or neural response allow neurons to learn to compute tensor decompositions.
