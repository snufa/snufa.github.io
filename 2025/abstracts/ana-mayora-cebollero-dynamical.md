## Abstract

The dynamical analysis of mean-field models of neural populations allows us to study the different dynamical regimes that are present when certain properties, such as synaptic dynamics, are taken into account or not. The well-known mean-field model of Montbrió-Pazó-Roxin [1] represents the dynamics of heterogeneous all-to-all coupled QIF spiking neural networks without synaptic dynamics (i.e., with instantaneous synapses), whereas the mean-field model of Dumont-Gutkin [2] represents such system but considering synaptic dynamics. Both models are linked through a parameter related to synaptic coupling [3, 4]. In this presentation, we provide an in-depth explanation of the dynamical changes that arise as this parameter is varied, using techniques such as numerical continuation and spike-counting sweeping.
