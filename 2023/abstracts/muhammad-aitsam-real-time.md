## Abstract

In recent years, there have been big improvements in event-based vision technology, thanks to new high-quality event cameras. These cameras are really good at capturing a wide range of moving things, and this has opened up new ways for robots and people to work together better, even in tricky environments. In this study, we use event-based vision to make a robot system that can understand and follow hand gestures. What's special about our approach is that it works well not just in normal lighting but also in dim or low-light settings. The implications of our work are profound, facilitating safer and more efficient collaboration between robots and human workers in shared workspaces
