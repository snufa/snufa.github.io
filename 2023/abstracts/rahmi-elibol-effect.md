## Abstract

Many different outcomes can be made from the models obtained with spiking neural networks. Some of these outcomes can be obtained from the spike counts of neurons such as firing rate, raster plot. On the other hand, some outcomes can be directly related to the calculation of local field potentials that do not depend on the number of spikes. In this study, we investigated how local field potentials, which are calculated by considering synaptic dynamics, change according to different neuron behaviors. A main group (MG) producing regular spikes was formed by 3 different neuron groups producing regular spikes (RS), chattering (CH) and fast spikes (FS). The MG is stimulated by the other three groups at different time intervals for the same duration and at a level that produces approximately the same number of spikes. Local Field Potentials (LFPs) were calculated from the MG, taking into account the synaptic dynamics and the distances of neuron locations to the electrode in a 3D structure. The frequency analysis of the obtained LFPs was performed and analyzed according to the behaviors of the excitatory neuron groups.
