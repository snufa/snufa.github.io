# SNUFA 2021

Like last year this online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

This year's executive committee comprises [Chiara Bartolozzi](https://www.iit.it/people/chiara-bartolozzi), [Sander Bohté](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~sbohte/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://fzenke.net/).


## Key dates

The workshop will take place **2-3 November, 2021** (please note change of date from original announcement).

~~Abstract submission will close **1 October, 2021**.~~

~~Acceptance notification expected by **18th of October, 2021**.~~

## Registration and submissions
