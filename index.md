## SNUFA

SNUFA is an online workshop and community focused on research advances in the field of "Spiking Networks as Universal Function Approximators."

[SNUFA 2022](/2022) will take place online 9-10 November 2022, European afternoons.

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/aYvgGakrVK) to chat about this research area, and to get announcements of new papers, conferences, jobs, grant schemes, etc.

The last years have seen many exciting new developments to train spiking neural networks to perform complex information processing. This annual online workshop brings together researchers in the field to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics of interest include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing.

The workshops are organised by [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org/) and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org).
