# SNUFA 2024

<img align="right" width="499" style="max-width: 40%" src="/images/snufa_hog.gif">

**Brief summary.** This online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

**Executive committee.** [Melika Payvand](https://services.ini.uzh.ch/people/melika), [Laurent Perrinet](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org/).

## Abstract submissions

Abstracts will be made publicly available at the end of the abstract submissions deadline for blinded public comments and ratings. We will select the most highly rated abstracts for contributed talks and flash talks, subject to maintaining a balance between the different fields of, broadly speaking, neuroscience, computer science and neuromorphic engineering. Abstracts not selected for a talk, and abstracts selected for a flash talk, will be presented as posters.


## Format

* Two half days
* 4 invited talks
* 7 contributed talks
* Flash talks by selected poster presenters
* Virtual poster session
