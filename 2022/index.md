# SNUFA 2022

<img align="right" width="300" style="max-width: 40%" src="/images/snufa2022_logo.png">

**Brief summary.** This online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

**Executive committee.** [Katie Schuman](https://catherineschuman.com/), [Timoth√©e Masquelier](https://cerco.cnrs.fr/pagesp/tim/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org/).

## Abstract submissions closed

[Abstracts are now publicly available for blinded public comments and ratings.](https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0pvzikmEV0MJe0C) We will select the most highly rated abstracts for contributed talks, subject to maintaining a balance between the different fields of, broadly speaking, neuroscience, computer science and neuromorphic engineering. Abstracts not selected for a talk will be presented as posters, and there is an option to submit an abstract directly for a poster and not a talk if you prefer.
