## Abstract

Evidence for metastable dynamics and its role in brain function is emerging at a fast pace and is changing our understanding of neural coding by putting an emphasis on hidden states of transient activity. Clustered networks of spiking neurons have enhanced synaptic connections among groups of neurons forming structures called cell assemblies; such networks are capable of producing metastable dynamics that is in agreement with many experimental results. However, it is unclear how a clustered network structure producing metastable dynamics may emerge from a fully local plasticity rule, i.e., a plasticity rule where each synapse has only access to the activity of the neurons it connects (as opposed to the activity of other neurons or other synapses). Here, we propose a local plasticity rule producing ongoing metastable dynamics in a deterministic, recurrent network of spiking neurons. The metastable dynamics co-exists with ongoing plasticity and is the consequence of a self-tuning mechanism that keeps the synaptic weights close to the instability line where memories are spontaneously reactivated. In turn, the synaptic structure is stable to ongoing dynamics and random perturbations, yet it remains sufficiently plastic to remap sensory representations to encode new sets of stimuli. Both the plasticity rule and the metastable dynamics scale well with network size, with synaptic stability increasing with the number of neurons. Overall, our results show that it is possible to generate metastable dynamics over meaningful hidden states using a simple but biologically plausible plasticity rule which co-exists with ongoing neural dynamics.
