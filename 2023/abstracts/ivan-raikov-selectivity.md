## Abstract

The dentate gyrus (DG) is an integral part of the hippocampal formation that is thought to perform pattern separation of sensory inputs in order to facilitate context-specific encoding necessary for the formation and retrieval of memories. However, it remains largely unknown how the specific circuit, cellular and synaptic properties of DG contribute to the process by which the hippocampus transforms its entorhinal cortical (EC) inputs into place fields.

We have developed a computational supervised learning methodology to obtain biophysically realistic distributions of excitatory synaptic weights (structured weights) that lead to spatially-tuned neural activity of biophysical models of dentate granule cells (DGC) during simulated running on a linear track. Our proposed model is robust to heterogeneous combinations of spatial inputs of different field sizes, and reproduces spatial tuning patterns observed in the rat dentate gyrus.  We have used this methodology to rapidly generate synaptic weight distributions for hundreds of thousands of granule cells of a 1:1 scale, neuroanatomically- and biophysically-detailed computational model of the rat dentate gyrus, with spatially-modulated inputs designed to mimic EC inputs, and we have used a parameter optimization strategy to determine synaptic conductance parameters that result in DGC place fields with signal-to-noise ratios similar to those observed experimentally.

Consistent with recent findings on dendritic integration, our model is predicated on the hypothesis that spatially distributed or asynchronous inputs are integrated linearly, whereas spatially and temporally correlated inputs induce dendritic nonlinearities via voltage-dependent NMDA receptor kinetics and short-term facilitation and depression, which in turn contribute to high signal-to-noise ratio in the somatic voltage response of the neuron.  We show that without the non-linear amplification effect of the combination of functional synaptic clusters and NMDA facilitation and depression, structured synaptic weights alone are not sufficient to generate somatic voltage depolarization that is consistent with experimentally observed place fields.
