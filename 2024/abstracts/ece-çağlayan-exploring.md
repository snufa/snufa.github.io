## Abstract

This study examines the effects of clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, on cognitive function in schizophrenia patients, focusing on the M1 receptor and its rs2067477 polymorphism. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the N-back task, using data from a previous study on clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients. Results showed a link between clozapine levels, cognitive performance, and the M1 receptor polymorphism. The wild-type group exhibited higher cortical activity in working memory regions compared to the non-wild-type group (CA/AA). Functional connectivity analysis using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data indicated increased brain oxygenation with task complexity, reflecting higher cognitive demand. While the M1 receptor polymorphism did not directly affect task performance, distinct brain activation and connectivity patterns were observed between wild-type and non-wild-type groups. The wild-type group displayed higher brain activation, implying greater resource use, whereas the non-wild-type group showed stronger connectivity. These findings provide insights into how genetic factors, cognitive function, and brain connectivity intersect in clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients. The study highlights the importance of considering genetic and environmental influences on brain connectivity during cognitive tasks to refine interventions aimed at improving cognitive outcomes.
