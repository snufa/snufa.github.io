# SNUFA 2022

<img align="right" width="300" src="/images/snufa2022_logo.png">

**Brief summary.** This online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

**Executive committee.** [Katie Schuman](https://catherineschuman.com/), [Timoth√©e Masquelier](https://cerco.cnrs.fr/pagesp/tim/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://fzenke.net/).

## Key dates

**Workshop**. November 2-3, European afternoons.

**Registration**. Free but mandatory, will open very soon.

**Abstract submission deadline**. Towards the end of September (to be finalised).

**Final decisions**. Early October (to be finalised).

## Format

* Two half days
* 4 invited talks
* 8 contributed talks
* Poster session
* Panel debate (topic to be decided)

## Abstract submissions

We will shortly post an abstract submissions form. Abstracts will be made publicly available at the end of the abstract submissions deadline for blinded public comments and ratings. We will select the most highly rated abstracts for contributed talks, subject to maintaining a balance between the different fields of, broadly speaking, neuroscience, computer science and neuromorphic engineering.
