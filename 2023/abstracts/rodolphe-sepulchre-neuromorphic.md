# Neuromorphic learning: a control perspective

**Authors:** Rodolphe Sepulchre

**Presentation type:** Invited talk at [SNUFA 2023 online workshop (7-8 Nov 2023)](https://snufa.net/2023)

## Abstract

Regarding spiking neural networks as mixed feedback systems enables a number 
of connections to be made between online learning, adaptive control, and biological 
neuromodulation. The talk will review this modeling framework, early attempts
to turn it into a neuromorphic implementation, and ongoing research to make it
algorithmic and scalable.
