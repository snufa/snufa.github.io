**Brief summary.** This online workshop brings together researchers in the fields of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering to present their work and discuss ways of translating these findings into a better understanding of neural circuits. Topics include artificial and biologically plausible learning algorithms and the dissection of trained spiking circuits toward understanding neural processing. We have a manageable number of talks with ample time for discussions.

**Program committee.** [David Kappel](https://www.ini.rub.de/the_institute/people/david-kappel/), [Julijana Gjorgjieva](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/compneuro/home/), [Dan Goodman](https://neural-reckoning.org), and [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org/).
